/*
  The 'react-hooks/rules-of-hooks' linting rules prevent React Hooks from being called
  inside of if() statements. This is because hooks must always be called in the same order
  every time a component is rendered. The 'react-hooks/rules-of-hooks' rule is disabled below
  because the "if (process.env.REACT_APP_SET_AUTH === 'firebase')" statements are evaluated
  at build time (not runtime). If the statement evaluates to false, then the code is not
  included in the bundle that is produced (due to tree-shaking). Thus, in this instance, it
  is ok to call hooks inside if() statements.
